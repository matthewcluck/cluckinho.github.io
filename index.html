<p>My name is Matthew Cluck and I am a GIS Specialist at <a href="https://www.responsegroupinc.com/gis-mapping-modeling" target="_blank">The Response Group</a>. I have been at The Response Group since March of 2020. Prior to that I was a part time analyst at the GIS company Pushpin, and prior to working there I received a Bachelor in Science in Geoscience and a minor in GIS from Texas Tech University. My day to day tasks at The Response Group are wide ranging. I use ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro daily and nearly have 2 years of professional experience with each, and much more experience from school (5+ years). I work with publishing to ArcServer daily and creating/editing SDE data. I have also created many apps for the company using different ESRI tools from ArcGIS Online as well as the developer editions of Web AppBuilder and Experience Builder. In addition to this, I use other software for modelling purposes that I tie into GIS. Finally, I assist with some Python scripting when appropriate. Here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11t20l62qChysi6WDvQJtvJ3PbwMgJWXb/view" target="_blank">resume</a>.
  
  <p>The below app I made using the JavaScript API. The grey lines show oil and gas pipelines I imported from the ESRI catalog of data. I also imported Texas County boundaries from the same data hub. I then added a 'draw graphics' widget on top. You can play around with this widget; the idea is you can draw out other pipelines with the line tool or mark points of interest with the other tools. I also created this website using my own HTML & CSS using GitHub pages. As for other personal projects, I am currently learning SQL, database design, PostgreSQL/PostGIS and tying it all together with QGIS. I plan on displaying a personal project with this technology shortly. </p>
  <p>I have a genuine passion for geography, technology, learning and creating. I appreciate you taking the time to visit my website.</p>
  <p><b>Thank you!</b></p>
