            <div class="book" id="1">Hi! My name is Matthew Cluck and I am a GIS Analyst/Advisor at Zonda Home. I do GIS data analysis for housing research. Previously I was a GIS Specialist in the Oil & Gas industry for nearly two years. Prior to that role I worked remotely as an Analyst for Nearmap. In 2018 I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Geoscience, with a Minor in GIS, from Texas Tech University where I was also a member of the football team. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently I am tinkering around trying to get better at programming day by day. I try to have a GIS flair to all of my projects. I have a couple of web GIS projects on my Github I am proud of. Currently I am doing some more data analysis work (currently SQL, possibly Python), and I plan on creating some blogs on Medium detailing my projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Professionally, I have deep knowledge (4+ years) of the ESRI Suite: &nbsp;ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online and Experience Builder. I am also working in PostGIS with some of our large datasets. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to view my website. Please do not hesitate to reach out at matthewacluck@gmail.com
