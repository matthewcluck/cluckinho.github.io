  <p>My name is Matthew Cluck and I recently graduated in December of 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Geology and a GIS minor from Texas Tech University. I just recently finished a semester at the University of Texas at San Antonio where I was playing football and doing some GIS graduate courses. I am also doing some freelance remote sensing work at home for the GIS company Pushpin out of Minnesota.
Here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ekUIIREC_i8E5hC_0z1PpHFP2OK0G7jx" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ziispjXa-fZOz9j8NizsbUzXIp-eBFST" target="_blank">portfolio.</a> My portfolio contains a few of my GIS projects and maps I have done throughout my college career. I am most proud of my NFL GIS analysis in the portfolio, and a link to the ESRI web app can be found <a href="http://texastech.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Media/index.html?appid=f7c9cc2b6e2c49a6955f1112267d8967" target="_blank">here.</a> I created this website myself using HTML and CSS, which I am still learning. I am also learning some JavaScript to help me with web development and the API from ESRI, which I go into more detail below. This is my latest GIS project and most advanced.</p>
    
  <p>The below app I made using the JavaScript API. The grey lines show oil and gas pipelines I imported from the ESRI catalog of data. I also imported Texas County boundaries from the same data hub. I then added a 'draw graphics' widget on top. You can play around with this widget; the idea is you can draw out other pipelines with the line tool or mark points of interest with the other tools. I just wanted to make a simple app from this API. Please ask me about this app so I can explain how I did it even more. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
