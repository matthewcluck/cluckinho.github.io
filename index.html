            <div class="book" id="1">Hi! My name is Matthew Cluck and I am a GIS Analyst/Advisor at Zonda Home. I do GIS data analysis for housing research. Previously I was a GIS Specialist in the Oil & Gas industry for nearly two years. Prior to that role I worked remotely as an Analyst for Nearmap. In 2018 I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Geoscience, with a Minor in GIS, from Texas Tech University where I was also a member of the football team. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My current interests lie in web development. I am self-teaching web development by using <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank" id="odin">theodinproject.com</a> as guidance. I feel like I have finally found a niche I really enjoy, and I try to learn about it every day. I made and hosted this site on my own, from scratch. One day I would love to join a role that leverages my strong GIS knowledge and web development skills. Perhaps Leaflet or the ESRI JavaScript API would be a good fit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Technical skills include deep knowledge (4+ years) of the ESRI Suite: &nbsp;ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online and Experience Builder. My day-to-day also often includes creating SQL queries and reports in MS Access, along with working with our larger databases in MS SQL Server. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to view my website. Please do not hesitate to reach out at matthewacluck@gmail.com
