<p>My name is Matthew Cluck and I am a GIS Specialist at The Response Group located in Houston Texas since the beginning of March 2020. My day to day work in this position changes frequently. Working for a disaster response company has taught me wide-ranging facets of geospatial work. I am adept in ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro at this point. I know some light python scripting to help me automate some map-making tasks, but I definitely have a long way to go on this front. I also have become quite familiar using ESRI's Web AppBuilder, Experience Builder, and story maps. I most recently made a COVID tracking dashboard in Web Appbuilder for the company. I work with SDE data on almost a daily basis; publishing to ArcServer as well. I also have intermediate experience with an oil spill modelling software known as Oilmap, and creating trajectory maps from the output. I graduated in December of 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Geology and a GIS minor from Texas Tech University. I just recently finished a semester at the University of Texas at San Antonio where I was playing football and doing some GIS graduate courses. I am also doing some freelance remote sensing work at home for the GIS company Pushpin out of Minnesota when I have time.
Here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WSlE68H1E-dKfj2igPz8t-cw6ikvengu/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">resume</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ziispjXa-fZOz9j8NizsbUzXIp-eBFST" target="_blank">portfolio.</a> My portfolio contains a few of my GIS projects and maps I have done throughout my college career. I am most proud of my NFL GIS analysis in the portfolio, and a link to the ESRI web app can be found <a href="http://texastech.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Media/index.html?appid=f7c9cc2b6e2c49a6955f1112267d8967" target="_blank">here.</a> I created this website myself using HTML and CSS, which I am still learning. I am hosting this page through GitHub, and the domain was purchased through Google. I am also learning some JavaScript to help me with web development and the API from ESRI, which I go into more detail below. This is my latest GIS project and most advanced.</p>
    
  <p>The below app I made using the JavaScript API. The grey lines show oil and gas pipelines I imported from the ESRI catalog of data. I also imported Texas County boundaries from the same data hub. I then added a 'draw graphics' widget on top. You can play around with this widget; the idea is you can draw out other pipelines with the line tool or mark points of interest with the other tools. I just wanted to make a simple app from this API. Please ask me about this app so I can explain how I did it in further detail. The app has not been updated since the beginning of 2020, but I plan on coming back to it soon. </p>
  <p><b>Thank you!</b></p>
