            <div class="book" id="1">Hi! My name is Matthew Cluck and I am a GIS Analyst/Advisor at Zonda Home. I do GIS data analysis for housing research. Previously I was a GIS Specialist in the Oil & Gas industry for nearly two years. Prior to that role I worked remotely as an Analyst for Nearmap. In 2018 I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Geoscience, with a Minor in GIS, from Texas Tech University where I was also a member of the football team. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently I am in getting a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Ball State. I am aiming to become a developer with a preference in GIS work. I graduate in Spring of 2026.
                <br>
                Professionally, I have deep knowledge (4+ years) of the ESRI Suite. I am also working in PostGIS doing projects with our larger datasets, and using QGIS for geocoding. On my own time I am currently doing projects in Jupyter notebooks using open source python GIS libraries.
                <br>
